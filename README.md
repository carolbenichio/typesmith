# Typesmith 🟦

This project is important to practice TypeScript. New syntax, as well as typing variables and functions, making your code more understandable and robust.

This is a Node Express API using Typescript.

For this project, I developed a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) of items, in the form of an API, using Typescript.

For that, I created some endpoints that will read and write to a database using MySQL.

Work in progress... 🛠️
